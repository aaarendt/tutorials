       "[Document(page_content='.. _astropy-coordinates-transforming:\\n\\nTransforming between Systems\\n****************************\\n\\n`astropy.coordinates` supports a rich system for transforming\\ncoordinates from one frame to another. While common astronomy frames\\nare built into Astropy, the transformation infrastructure is dynamic.\\nThis means it allows users to define new coordinate frames and their\\ntransformations. The topic of writing your own coordinate frame or\\ntransforms is detailed in :ref:`astropy-coordinates-design`, and this\\nsection is focused on how to *use* transformations.\\n\\nThe full list of built-in coordinate frames, the included transformations,\\nand the frame names are shown as a (clickable) graph in the\\n`~astropy.coordinates` API documentation.\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n\\n..\\n  EXAMPLE START\\n  Transforming Coordinates to Another Frame\\n\\nThe recommended method of transformation is shown below::\\n\\n    >>> import astropy.units as u\\n    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord\\n    >>> gc = SkyCoord(l=0*u.degree, b=45*u.degree, frame=\\'galactic\\')\\n    >>> gc.fk5  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP\\n    <SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J2000.000): (ra, dec) in deg\\n        ( 229.27251463, -1.12844288)>\\n\\nWhile this appears to be ordinary attribute-style access, it is actually\\nsyntactic sugar for the more general\\n:meth:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.transform_to` method, which can\\naccept either a frame name, class, or instance::\\n\\n    >>> from astropy.coordinates import FK5\\n    >>> gc.transform_to(\\'fk5\\')  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP\\n    <SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J2000.000): (ra, dec) in deg\\n        ( 229.27251463, -1.12844288)>\\n    >>> gc.transform_to(FK5)  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP\\n    <SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J2000.000): (ra, dec) in deg\\n        ( 229.27251463, -1.12844288)>\\n    >>> gc.transform_to(FK5(equinox=\\'J1980.0\\'))  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP\\n    <SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J1980.000): (ra, dec) in deg\\n        ( 229.0146935, -1.05560349)>\\n\\n..\\n  EXAMPLE END\\n\\n..\\n  EXAMPLE START\\n  Using SkyCoord Objects as the Frame in Transformations\\n\\nAs a convenience, it is also possible to use a |SkyCoord| object as the frame in\\n:meth:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.transform_to`. This allows for putting one\\ncoordinate object into the frame of another::\\n\\n    >>> sc = SkyCoord(ra=1.0, dec=2.0, unit=\\'deg\\', frame=FK5, equinox=\\'J1980.0\\')\\n    >>> gc.transform_to(sc)  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP\\n    <SkyCoord (FK5: equinox=J1980.000): (ra, dec) in deg\\n        ( 229.0146935, -1.05560349)>\\n\\n..\\n  EXAMPLE END\\n\\n..\\n  EXAMPLE START\\n  Self Transformations of Coordinate Frames\\n\\nSome coordinate frames (including `~astropy.coordinates.FK5`,\\n`~astropy.coordinates.FK4`, and `~astropy.coordinates.FK4NoETerms`) support\\n\"self transformations,\" meaning the *type* of frame does not change, but the\\nframe attributes do. An example is precessing a coordinate from one equinox\\nto another in an equatorial frame. This is done by passing ``transform_to`` a\\nframe class with the relevant attributes, as shown below.
