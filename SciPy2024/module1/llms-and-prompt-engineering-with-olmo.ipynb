    "An introduction to large language models and how they're trained is out of scope, but they have been trained over large amounts of textual information. Getting into the weeds of how these models are trained is out of the scope of this tutorial, but we have added links to papers and tutorials if you'd like to understand how LLMs are trained. Do note that training LLMs is expensive; the cost can go up to millions of dollars. "

Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of the matter in the universe, while visible matter only occupies about 5% of the cosmic composition. The term \"dark\" does not refer to a color, but rather it\\'s a way to describe elements that do not emit, absorb, or reflect light as we can detect them.\\n\\nThe existence of dark matter is based on various astrophysical and cosmological observations. Astronomers have observed how gravity affects the motion of celestial bodies in our galaxy, and this motion does not match what would be predicted by the visible mass of those bodies. This discrepancy between the expected gravitational motion and the actual motion suggests that there must be additional matter contributing to the total mass density of the universe.\\n\\nOne popular hypothesis for dark matter\\'s nature is that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are thought to be stable, non-radioactive particles with masses between one and 100 atomic mass units. These particles could have been formed during the early stages of the universe\\'s expansion and still exist in sufficient quantities to explain the observed dark matter density.\\n\\nDespite its theoretical nature, the concept of dark matter plays a vital role in our understanding of the cosmos, helping us comprehend the intricate relationships between the observable universe, gravitational forces, and cosmic evolution. The existence of dark matter is still uncertain and subject to ongoing scientific research.'}"
